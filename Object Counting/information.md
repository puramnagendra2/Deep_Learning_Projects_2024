# Object Detection and Counting System: Image and Video Analysis

## Project Overview

This project involves developing a deep learning-based system that detects various objects in an uploaded image or video, stores the detected objects, and allows the user to select an object from a list to display its count in the image or video.

## Steps to Develop the Project

### 1. **Define the Project Requirements**
    - Objective: Detect objects in images/videos and count selected objects.
    - Input: Images or videos uploaded by the user.
    - Output: List of detected objects and count of the selected object.
    - Hardware: Camera (optional), GPU for faster processing.

### 2. **Set Up the Development Environment**
    - Install Python and libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV, Flask/Django.
    - Set up a GPU-enabled environment for efficient model training and inference.
    - Use tools like Jupyter Notebook or an IDE (e.g., VS Code).

### 3. **Collect and Prepare the Dataset**
    - Gather a dataset with images/videos containing objects of interest.
    - Annotate the dataset using tools like LabelImg or CVAT.
    - Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.

### 4. **Develop or Fine-Tune an Object Detection Model**
    - Use pre-trained models like YOLO, SSD, or Faster R-CNN.
    - Fine-tune the model on the prepared dataset to detect specific objects.
    - Optimize the model for real-time performance.

### 5. **Implement Object Detection and Storage**
    - Use the detection model to identify objects in the uploaded image/video.
    - Extract and store detected objects with their labels and bounding boxes.
    - Display the list of detected objects to the user.

### 6. **Implement Object Counting Logic**
    - Allow the user to select an object from the detected list.
    - Count the occurrences of the selected object in the image/video.
    - Handle overlapping objects and occlusions.

### 7. **Develop the User Interface**
    - Create a web-based interface using Flask or Django.
    - Provide options to upload images/videos and view detected objects.
    - Display the count of the selected object in a user-friendly format.

### 8. **Optimize and Test the System**
    - Optimize the model using techniques like quantization or pruning.
    - Test the system with various image/video resolutions and object types.
    - Evaluate accuracy using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.

### 9. **Deploy the System**
    - Deploy the system on a server or edge device.
    - Ensure the system is scalable and robust for real-world usage.
    - Provide documentation for users and administrators.
