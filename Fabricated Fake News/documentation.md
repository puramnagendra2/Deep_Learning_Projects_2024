## Methodology Adopted

### Word Embedding with GloVe:
* Words are converted into dense numerical vectors using pre-trained GloVe embeddings. These vectors capture the semantic meaning of words in a high-dimensional space.

### Embedding Matrix:
* A mapping is created between the dataset's vocabulary and the GloVe vectors, allowing the model to use these pre-trained embeddings for better understanding of word relationships.

### Model Design:
* A sequential deep learning model is built, starting with an embedding layer that uses the GloVe embeddings. This layer is set to non-trainable to retain the pre-trained knowledge.

### LSTM Layers:
* Two Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers are added to process the text sequentially and capture dependencies between words in the input data.

### Classification Layers with Dropout:
* Dense layers are used for classification, with ReLU activation for intermediate layers and sigmoid activation for the final output. Dropout layers are included to reduce overfitting and improve generalization.
