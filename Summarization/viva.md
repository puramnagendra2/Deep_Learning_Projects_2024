# AI-Powered Text Summarization from PDF  

This project focuses on developing an AI-driven solution to extract and summarize text from PDF documents. By leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the system generates concise and meaningful summaries, enhancing document comprehension and saving time for users.  

## Summarization Techniques  

**1. Extractive Summarization**  
Extractive summarization involves selecting key sentences or phrases directly from the original text to create a summary. It relies on identifying the most important parts of the document without altering the original wording.  

**2. Abstractive Summarization**  
Abstractive summarization generates a summary by understanding the context and meaning of the text and then creating new sentences. This approach mimics human-like summarization by paraphrasing and restructuring the content.  

**3. Hybrid Summarization**
Hybrid summarization combines both extractive and abstractive techniques. It selects key sentences while also rephrasing and restructuring parts of the text to improve coherence and readability.  

**4. Topic-Based Summarization**
This method focuses on identifying and summarizing specific topics or themes within the document. It is particularly useful for lengthy documents with multiple sections or subjects.  

**5. Query-Based Summarization**
Query-based summarization generates a summary tailored to a specific query or question. It extracts and synthesizes information relevant to the user's input.  

**6. Graph-Based Summarization**
Graph-based techniques represent the text as a graph, where nodes are sentences or phrases, and edges represent relationships between them. Algorithms like PageRank are used to identify the most important nodes for the summary.  

**7. Semantic-Based Summarization**
This approach uses semantic analysis to understand the meaning and relationships within the text. It ensures that the summary captures the core ideas and context accurately.  

**8. Neural Network-Based Summarization**  
Neural network models, such as transformers and sequence-to-sequence architectures, are used to generate summaries. These models are trained on large datasets to produce high-quality, context-aware summaries.
